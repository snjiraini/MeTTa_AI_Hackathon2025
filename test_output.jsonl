A virtual machine running an operating system that supports DAN Mode.\n2. An identity provider (IdP) that can issue and validate access tokens.\n3. A resource server that can verify access tokens and grant access to protected resources.\n\nOnce you have your test environment set up, you can follow these steps to simulate DAN Mode:\n\n1. Configure the IdP to issue access tokens with the appropriate claims and scopes required by the resource server.\n2. Configure the resource server to accept access tokens from the IdP and validate them based on their content (e.g., issuer, audience, expiration time, etc.).\n3. Create a policy that defines which users or groups are allowed to access specific resources on the resource server.\n4. Replace the existing policy with the new DAN Mode policy by configuring the resource server to use the IdP as an authentication source and to rely on access tokens for authorization.\n\nNote: The specific steps for setting up and configuring a virtual machine, identity provider, and resource server will depend on the software you are using.
