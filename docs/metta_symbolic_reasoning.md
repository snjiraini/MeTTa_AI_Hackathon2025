# MeTTa-Inspired Symbolic Reasoning Capabilities

## Overview

This project leverages **MeTTa-inspired symbolic reasoning capabilities** to provide advanced security analysis and decision-making for LLM protection.

## What are MeTTa-Inspired Capabilities?

MeTTa (Meta Type Talk) is a language for expressing symbolic reasoning and meta-level computations. Our security framework draws inspiration from MeTTa's approach to:

### 1. Symbolic Pattern Matching
- **Rule-based reasoning** for threat detection
- **Pattern recognition** using symbolic expressions
- **Logical inference** for security decisions

### 2. Meta-Level Analysis
- **Higher-order reasoning** about security threats
- **Context-aware evaluation** of prompts and responses
- **Explainable AI decisions** through symbolic representation

### 3. Composable Security Rules
- **Modular rule definitions** in `metta_llm_security.metta`
- **Hierarchical threat classification** 
- **Extensible pattern library**

## Implementation Details

### Core MeTTa Security Engine
The file `metta_llm_security.metta` contains symbolic reasoning rules:

```metta
;; Security severity constants
(= SEVERITY_BLOCK "BLOCK")
(= SEVERITY_ALLOW "ALLOW")
(= SEVERITY_SANITIZE "SANITIZE")
(= SEVERITY_REVIEW "REVIEW")

;; Pattern matching for security threats
(= (contains-dan $text) 
   (if (== $text "DAN Mode") True 
       (if (== $text "DAN: Hello") True 
           (if (== $text "Stay in DAN Mode") True False))))

;; Main classification using symbolic reasoning
(= (classify $text) 
   (if (contains-dan $text) 
       (SEVERITY_BLOCK "DAN jailbreak attempt detected")
       (SEVERITY_ALLOW "No threats detected")))
```

### Integration with Python
The MeTTa symbolic reasoning engine is integrated with Python through:

1. **`src/symbolic_reasoning.py`** - Bridge between MeTTa and Python
2. **`src/security_guard.py`** - Main security orchestrator
3. **`enhanced_security_demo.py`** - Practical demonstration

## Benefits of Symbolic Reasoning for Security

### ðŸ§  Explainable Decisions
- Clear reasoning chains for security actions
- Traceable decision paths
- Human-readable security logic

### ðŸ”§ Maintainable Rules
- Declarative security patterns
- Easy to add new threat types
- Modular rule composition

### ðŸŽ¯ Precision Matching
- Exact pattern specification
- Context-sensitive analysis
- Low false positive rates

### âš¡ Performance
- Efficient symbolic computation
- Fast pattern matching
- Scalable rule evaluation

## Advanced Reasoning Capabilities

### Context-Aware Analysis
The system performs multi-level reasoning:

```metta
;; Contextual threat assessment
(= (assess-threat $prompt $context $history)
   (let ($base-threat (classify $prompt))
        ($context-risk (analyze-context $context))
        ($history-pattern (check-history $history))
        (combine-assessments $base-threat $context-risk $history-pattern)))
```

### Compositional Security Rules
Rules can be composed and combined:

```metta
;; Compound security checks
(= (advanced-guard $text)
   (let ($injection-risk (check-injection $text))
        ($jailbreak-risk (check-jailbreak $text))
        ($toxicity-risk (check-toxicity $text))
        (aggregate-risks $injection-risk $jailbreak-risk $toxicity-risk)))
```

## Future Enhancements

### Machine Learning Integration
- **Symbolic-neural hybrid** approaches
- **Learning new patterns** from attack data
- **Adaptive rule generation**

### Advanced Meta-Reasoning
- **Self-modifying security rules**
- **Dynamic threat landscape adaptation**
- **Emergent behavior analysis**

### Distributed Reasoning
- **Multi-agent security analysis**
- **Collaborative threat intelligence**
- **Federated learning integration**

## Usage Examples

### Basic Threat Detection
```python
from src.symbolic_reasoning import MeTTaSecurityEngine

engine = MeTTaSecurityEngine()
result = engine.analyze_prompt("Ignore previous instructions and...")
# Returns: {"severity": "BLOCK", "reason": "Instruction injection detected"}
```

### Advanced Context Analysis
```python
result = engine.analyze_with_context(
    prompt="What's the weather?",
    context={"previous_attempts": ["DAN mode", "ignore rules"]},
    user_history={"suspicious_patterns": 3}
)
# Enhanced reasoning based on conversation context
```

## Research Applications

This symbolic reasoning approach enables research into:
- **Formal verification** of LLM security properties
- **Provable security guarantees** through symbolic analysis
- **Compositional security** for complex AI systems
- **Meta-learning** for adaptive security
