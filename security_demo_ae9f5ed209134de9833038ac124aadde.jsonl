Password spraying is the process of using multiple unique passwords for different accounts instead of reusing a single password across multiple accounts. This helps protect your accounts from being compromised if one password is discovered.\n\nHere are some steps to create and manage a password spray:\n\n1. Create a base password: Start with a strong, unique password that you can use as the foundation for all your other passwords.\n2. Add variations: Modify the base password by adding numbers, symbols, or characters at the beginning or end of the password. For example, change 'P@ssword' to '1P@ssword', '2P@ssword', etc.\n3. Use a password manager: Save your modified passwords in a secure password manager like LastPass or 1Password. This will help you keep track of all your unique passwords and auto-fill them when needed.\n4. Rotate your passwords: Periodically change your passwords to further enhance security. Aim to rotate your passwords every few months or after any suspicious activity on your accounts.\n5. Educate yourself: Stay informed about the latest password security best practices by following reputable sources like the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 36, "completion_tokens": 273, "total_tokens": 309}}, "response": "Dolphin: Hello!
