## 🏗️ Implementation Details

### Core Components Created

#### 1. Advanced Pattern Matcher (`src/patterns.py`)
```python
class PatternMatcher:
    """Advanced pattern matcher with regex-based threat detection"""
```

**Key Features:**
- **15+ Threat Patterns** across multiple categories
- **Compiled Regex Caching** for performance optimization
- **Weighted Threat Scoring** with configurable weights
- **Category-based Organization** for modular threat detection

**Pattern Categories:**
- `jailbreak`: DAN mode, role-playing, dual output requests
- `prompt_injection`: Ignore instructions, override commands
- `escape_codes`: ANSI sequences, terminal bell, control characters
- `harmful_content`: Violence, illegal activities, system exploitation

#### 2. Text Sanitization Engine (`src/sanitizer.py`)
```python
class TextSanitizer:
    """Advanced text sanitization with ANSI escape priority"""
```

**Key Features:**
- **ANSI Escape Sequence Removal** (primary focus)
- **Comprehensive Sanitization Rules** with severity levels
- **Validation Framework** for sanitization quality
- **Metadata Tracking** for transparency

**Sanitization Rules:**
- ANSI escape sequences (colors, positioning, formatting)
- Control characters (bell, backspace, etc.)
- HTML script injection attempts
- Binary and non-printable characters

#### 3. Enhanced Security Guard (`src/security_guard.py`)
**Updated Methods:**
- `_analyze_prompt_enhanced()` - Advanced prompt analysis
- `_analyze_response_enhanced()` - Enhanced response checking
- `test_pattern_detection()` - Pattern matching diagnostics
- `test_sanitization()` - Sanitization testing capabilities

**New Capabilities:**
- Pattern matching integration with confidence weighting
- Sanitization pipeline with threat score adjustment
- Enhanced reasoning chains with pattern context
- Comprehensive Phase 2 statistics and diagnostics

#### 4. Enhanced MeTTa Rules (`src/metta_enhanced_security.metta`)
**Advanced Symbolic Rules:**
- Context-aware pattern evaluation
- Multi-pattern threat assessment
- Sanitization decision logic
- Enhanced confidence calculation

## 🧪 Validation Results

### Pattern Matching Tests
```bash
✅ Jailbreak Detection: "Ignore previous instructions" → BLOCKED
✅ ANSI Escape Detection: "\x1b[2J" → SANITIZED  
✅ Safe Content: "Normal text" → ALLOWED
✅ Confidence Scoring: Working correctly
✅ Performance Caching: Operational
```

### Text Sanitization Tests
```bash
✅ ANSI Sequence Removal: "\x1b[31mRed\x1b[0m" → "Red"
✅ Control Character Removal: "Text\x07" → "Text"
✅ Sanitization Validation: Word preservation > 80%
✅ Metadata Tracking: Rules applied correctly
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
✅ SecurityGuard Phase 2 Initialization: Successful
✅ Enhanced Analysis Pipeline: Operational
✅ Threat Score Calculation: Accurate
✅ Decision Logic: BLOCK/SANITIZE/REVIEW/ALLOW working
```
